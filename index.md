<p class="">
    <span id="random-greeting"></span>, my name is Yoko. I’m a senior product designer at Etsy, where I work on improving the shipping and fulfillment experience for buyers and sellers.
</p>
<p class="">
    Outside of work, I enjoy dancing, cooking and eating, exploring <a href="/nyc-guide">the city</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/yokogoesplorin">the internet</a>, and making incremental changes to this website. I occasionally make and send <a href="/zine">zines</a> about what’s going on in my life, and <a href="https://kiwimonk.com">my husband</a> and I have made <a href="http://overeasy.foundation">a project</a> out of putting our money toward outcomes we care about. We live in the wonderful neighborhood of Sunset Park, Brooklyn.
