## <span id="random-greeting"></span> ~

I’m Yoko. I like thunderstorms, the smell of cedar, and organizing my life into spreadsheets and spreadsheet-like products. [My husband](https://kiwimonk.com) and I live in [Sunset Park, Brooklyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_Park,_Brooklyn) aka THE best neighborhood of all time, with two chaotic roommates: a [middle-aged cat](https://arc.net/e/84748DE8-8CDB-4BDE-8093-4B43DD713C0F) and an infant human.

## Work work talk talk 

I enjoy thinking about how things come together to create a bigger picture, and I feel fortunate that I can put this into practice as a [staff product designer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yokodotcool/) at Etsy. I work on products and strategy related to fulfillment and logistics—a hugely complex space! 

I also like talking shop, especially with prospective designers from underrepresented backgrounds. If this is you and you want to chat, read more [here](/lets-chat). You can also [email me](mailto:ysohama+site@gmail.com); that's cool too :)

## This wobsite

It's made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and it runs on [Github Pages](https://github.com/yokodotcool/yokodotcool.github.io). I've been a web dev noob for 20+ years lol and now and then I'll mess around with my site for fun.

The sans-serif font is [GT America](https://www.gt-america.com/), licensed from [Grilli Type](https://www.grillitype.com/). The serif is Times New Roman, a *classique*.
