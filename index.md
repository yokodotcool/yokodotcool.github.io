<span id="random-greeting"></span>, my name is Yoko. I like to dance, cook and eat, explore [the city](/nyc-guide) and [the internet](https://twitter.com/yokogoesplorin), and make incremental changes to this website. Sometimes I make [zines](/zine). [My partner](https://kiwimonk.com) and I have made [a project](http://overeasy.foundation) out of using our money to contribute toward outcomes we care about. We live in the wonderful neighborhood of [Sunset Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_Park,_Brooklyn) with our [cat]({% post_url 2021-10-06-we-have-adopted-a-cat %}). 

I work at [Etsy](https://etsy.com), where I’m a senior product designer on the shipping and fulfillment team. I enjoy talking about my job! If you’re interested in entering the field, I offer free mentoring to diverse, underrepresented, prospective talent through [Merit](https://www.get-merit.com/p/yoko-sakao-ohama). Otherwise, [send me an email](mailto:ysohama+site@gmail.com) :) 

Thanks for stopping by!
