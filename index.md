<span id="random-greeting"></span>, my name is Yoko. I like to dance, cook and eat, explore <a href="/nyc-guide">the city</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/yokogoesplorin">the internet</a>, and make incremental changes to this website. Sometimes I make <a href="/zine">zines</a>. <a href="https://kiwimonk.com">My partner</a> and I have made <a href="http://overeasy.foundation">a project</a> out of using our money to contribute toward outcomes we care about. We live in the wonderful neighborhood of Sunset Park, Brooklyn. 

My day job is at <a href="https://etsy.com">Etsy</a>. I’m a senior product designer on the shipping and fulfillment team. I enjoy talking about the work — the problems to solve, the cross-functional collaboration, the industries of UX design and e-commerce — and offer free coaching/mentoring sessions to diverse, underrepresented, prospective talent through <a href="https://www.get-merit.com/p/yoko-sakao-ohama">Merit</a>.

If you’d like to get in touch, <a href="mailto:ysohama+site@gmail.com">send me an email</a>.
