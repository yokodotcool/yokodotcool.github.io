We made up a food today. I don’t have pics yet bc we took photos with a real camera and not a phone, so I’m just gonna describe it with words and come back with photos when I get my hands on em.

Some time ago, we ordered takeout from a Yemeni place and it came with these biggo (like 16" diameter) flatbreads. So we froze them and have been using them as bases for pizza. Today, we made a “pizza” where the “sauce” was eggs mixed with plain Greek yogurt, and topped with mushroom, green pepper, mozz, and olive oil. Idk if this is a food that already exists (it’s kinda like a frittata in taste, but flat like a thin-crust pizza) but MY PEEPS IT WAS SO GOOD
