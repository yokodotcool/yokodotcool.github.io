I tweeted about this video before the dawn of WAWD (holy cow has it been half a year?), but it’s so good that it’s worth watching again if you haven’t already.

I see few urban dancers kick as high or turn as plentifully as Quick Crew does, and it adds such energy to their choreography. They might not be in sync all the time (there are only three of them! Shouldn’t that make it easier? Or is it the opposite?) but the chemistry they have with each other, and with their captive audience is unmistakable. Brace yourself for the part where they make the crowd go insane just by WALKING to them.

*Quick starts [a minute in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jQA3fpGBE#t=60), though I gotta say, the guy-girl students who dance in the beginning really add a layer of sensuality to the choreography.*

PS: Another [a-maz-ing choreography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEB_CzvouIU) (4:30) that I shared in a [VSL](http://www.veryshortlist.com/culture/daily.cfm/review/2496/Current_cinema/yoko/?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_term=Very%20Short%20List%20-%20Daily&utm_campaign=VSL), to will.i.am’s “Great Times.”

PPS: Quick is currently riding out the wave they created with this [slightly disconcerting choreo(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCCYh25F1Iw)] (2:41)—to me, anyway—that appropriates some Asian imagery. To their credit, the performance uses a really dope track by Hifana, a Japanese band that makes some [trippy dippy music videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY6iyZzpamg) (4:07). Oh, and the dancing is pretty good, too. I don’t know how to feel.
