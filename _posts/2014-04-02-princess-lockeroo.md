Waacking is a street dance originating in 1970’s LA disco scene. It is a little bit like [Voguing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(dance)) (which was born in Harlem) in its highly stylized, highly sassy attitude, but has a much stronger emphasis on musicality and arm movement. 

Princess Lockeroo is a student of one of the fathers of waacking, Tyrone Proctor. I’ve taken a class with her, and have personally witnessed her amazing ability to, as she calls it, “anticipate the beat.” Her astounding familiarity with disco-style music and her super-in-shape arms<a href="#fn:1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> make for crisp movement that could split the air in half. 

I’ve been wanting to share a video of Princess Lockeroo for a while, but having seen her in person, I just haven’t found one that I think really does her talent justice.<a href="#fn:2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> This one comes pretty close. I would like to imagine that this is what I would look like if I had a soundtrack to getting ready for a night out.

		PS: If you’re in the NYC area and interested in waacking, Princess Lockeroo teaches <a href="https://www.broadwaydancecenter.com/faculty/bios/lockerooo_princess.shtml">a class four days a week</a> at Broadway Dance Center. It is super, super fun. Be prepared for your arms to feel like noodles by the end of the class though.

		<li id="fn:1">In class, I asked Lockeroo what part of her body hurts the most after dancing. She responded, “My <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezius">traps</a>. They’re like rocks.” Thumbs up.</li>
		<li id="fn:2">Lockeroo was also a contestant on SYTYCD S8. She didn’t make it past the audition round (and honestly I felt that the show did not really respect her or the dance), but she did get a brief segment and also a performance on air. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ea053QadGY">Here it is</a> (3:34).</li>
