One day, while third-wheeling at a meeting, I drew a bunch of pandas, and then I made a pattern out of them.

Below are some of my favorites:

![3 pandas about to jump, being Kevin, and bawlin](/assets/images/2014-07-01-pandas_doing_stuff-closeup-2.jpg)

![2 pandas floating, contemplating life, plus a bonus cat laptop](/assets/images/2014-07-01-pandas_doing_stuff-closeup-3.jpg)

At my friend [Aceâ€™s](http://aceboothby.com) encouragement, I will be making some kind of apparel out of the pattern. Stay tuned!
