Shaun Evaristo has been on the scene since the inception of video sharing. He toured with Justin Bieber during Justin’s “crazy days” (and [danced in the airport]({% post_url 2014-02-19-justin-biebers-dancers-at-the-airport %}) when his tour flight got cancelled—black sweatshirt, hat with the brim to the side). He founded [Movement Lifestyle](http://www.themovementlifestyle.com/), a dance company that manages talent, studios, and fosters a community of dancers in LA and around the world. And he still finds time to create and share his art. He is a legend.

Shaun is dancing his choreo in only part of this video (toward the end, at [1:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NraARjfTGlk&feature=youtu.be&t=1m54s)), but I encourage you to watch the whole thing from the very beginning. The feel of this video, and the reason why I’m sharing it, is best described by the person who posted it:

> This video is not just choreo—it’s an attempt to capture the feeling Shaun brought to class every day and undoubtedly brings with him everywhere he goes: passion, playfulness, and a desire to get dancers to feel more connected to the music and themselves. He brought an unparalleled energy to his workshop and this is our tribute to him.

I had the pleasure of meeting Shaun earlier this year, and the above description is spot on. His love for dance and his desire to spread art are pure. Watching him dance is a privilege, and I can’t even begin to think about what it would be like to be in a class with him. Plus, he’s just a chill dude, man. Really nice, amazing, talented guy.

Can’t get over how he keeps dancing even after the class choreo, even as the camera guy gets up to stop the video. You can tell he really loves it.
