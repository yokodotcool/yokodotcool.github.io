Heyo! Here’s a super-chill, wholesomely fun video for this holiday weekend. I just love how casual this video feels, and I can’t figure out if it’s a super high FPS or if the video is actually slowed down a little bit, but Camron Branch just makes his bboy moves look SO easy. Maybe he is just that good.

Plus, this song is my JAM. Dang!

*I also love that the official Youtube account for Downtown Colorado Springs shared it, too. Adorable.*
