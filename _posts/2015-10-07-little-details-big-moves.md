Surely you’ve heard of Les Twins? The French brothers (yes, twins) Laurent and Larry Bourgeois who reached the upper echelons of commercial dance by touring with Beyoncé last year? Anyway …

This video was shot in 4K, which might seem excessive for a wide shot of two people dancing. But Les Twins can capture the quickest of beats with the most minute of movements—seriously, what fraction of a beat is that triple hit that they keep on magically nailing? All of their grooves, on the other hand, are so fluid, that even with high-resolution video, it still looks as smooth as butter. That corkscrew move by Larry ([1:05](https://youtu.be/4kcDmKCK--o?t=1m5s)) is mindblowing.

Note: It inexplicably turns into an ad for those electric unicycle things they’re riding on at about 3:10.
