Locking is a funk-style street dance characterized by (1) quick movements tightly synced with music, interspersed with (2) “locking” in specific conditions. In some ways, it’s like the older brother to [waacking]({% post_url 2014-04-02-princess-lockeroo %}) with a more lighthearted, James Brown-y flavor.

By nature, locking is such a fun dance that, even in battle form, it appears to be an exchange of banter rather than a competition of skill. It makes me smile to see Firelock (the man) and Jimini (the woman) head off in this final round of a competition; the respect and camaraderie between them is apparent.

If you’re interested in learning a bit more about the key grooves and poses of locking, I highly highly highly recommend [this website](http://www.reallusion.com/contentstore/iClone/pack/StreetDance_Locking/default.aspx) that use computer generated Sims-liked characters to demonstrate locking moves. It is epic.
