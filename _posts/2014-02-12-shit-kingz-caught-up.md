Shit Kingz is a dance quartet based out of Japan. They are obviously talented dancers, and from extensive research (i.e., obsessive video-watching) I have found that, when they are dancing, they are grinning about 80% of the time. They are adorable.

There are so many things that make Shit Kingz an amazing crew, but I chose this video for just one reason. The first time I watched this, it took me about a third of the video to get what was going on, so I’ll just give you a hint right now: the music gets warped on purpose, and only during certain parts of the choreography. 

It’s okay; you can watch it again. I’ve watched this video so many times I’ve lost count.
