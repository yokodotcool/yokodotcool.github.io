I’m definitely a urban/street dance person more than anything else, but I do have a small fondness for contemporary dance, and Marissa Osato’s beautiful style knows exactly how to hit that spot.

Combine Marissa’s choreo with the subtly upbeat “Don’t Save Me” by HAIM and you’ve got a winner. Bonus, an appearance by Sorah Yang (purple shirt) doing something ENTIRELY different from her [Young Thug choreo]({% post_url 2014-10-22-sorah-yang-old-english %})! Though I do admit, Emily Crouch (white shirt + headband) easily steals the show.

Holy cow those kicks! Those lines! Makes me feel inadequate just sitting here typing on my computer. Gotta go do some stretches after this.
