In case you were wondering, [Kyle Hanagami is back]({% post_url 2015-02-18-love-strength-giving %}), and he is back with an effing BANG.

Kyle, the choreographer of this piece, makes a brief appearance here (teaching the class in the first few seconds), but this video is about his students. Sometimes, the best way to know that you’ve made it is when you watch the people learning from you and you’re like, DANG! It must be so rewarding to see the fruits of your labor in the form of other people just destroying your choreo.

It’s also really neat to see how different dance can look depending on who is dancing and how they’re doing it. Really goes to show that choreography is only just a part of the performance, and the method of delivery is the crucial key to getting that last 5% look exactly how you want it.
