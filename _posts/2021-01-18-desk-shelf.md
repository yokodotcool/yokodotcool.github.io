![A photo of my desk in our bedroom! More on that maybe another time. The desk is empty except for a shelf made of wood; on the shelf there is a desk lamp, and to the left of the shelf on the desk is a NYTimes mug with pens and stuff in it.](/assets/images/2021-01-18-desk-shelf.jpg)

Spent a lot of off-screen time making these shelves today, using some planks from Ikea and scrap wood from my parents’ old kitchen. Felt nice to be working with our hands and making stuff that one might spend a couple hundred dollars on 😁
