Apologies for the GIF. I wasn’t sure how else to convey the sheer fun of this video.

It’s been a while since I last raved about Japanese quartet Shit Kingz, so let’s do a quick review. The video has some amazing moves throughout, but there are a few that are very characteristic to Shit Kingz, and they happen in a twelve-second span:

- For a dance team that has only four people in it, Shit Kingz is incredible at keeping their blocking fresh. I love the way they rotate AND switch the lines on their formation so seamlessly at [1:10](http://youtu.be/v8Vgs9tMfIw?t=1m10s).
- The staggered timing of the point-and-swing arms at [1:13](http://youtu.be/v8Vgs9tMfIw?t=1m13s) almost looks like a mistake but it’s not, and by the time you realize they’re even doing it, they’re back in sync again. I mentioned a similar move in a previous newsletter and I still don’t know if there’s any term for it aside from “complete sorcery.”
- A really sneaky thing they do: appear to be doing the same move, but somehow ending up facing in completely different directions at [1:18](http://youtu.be/v8Vgs9tMfIw?t=1m18s).

[I have written]({% post_url 2014-03-26-shit-kingz-hip-drop %}) about all of these “tricks” before, but they continue to look novel and every time they put it in a new choreo, it’s like watching it for the first time. Hell, I feel like I could go back and watch their older videos over, and over, and over again, and I’ll still discover something new.

PS: [The exact same choreo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeCjeuQoX5s) (4:28) taught at a different workshop, with an appearance at the end by Keoni Madrid, Mari Madrid, and Jillian Meyers (whom I haven’t yet written about but SO WANT TO).

PPS: An equally impressive, but uncharacteristically(?) moodier, [choreo to Gotye](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugfCHu9SUCI) (3:47).
