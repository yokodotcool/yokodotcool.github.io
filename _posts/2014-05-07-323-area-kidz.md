Ooohhh, you are in for a treat! You’re about to watch the most mind-blowing, brain-banging, jaw-dropping group of HIGH SCHOOL students, and you’re going to get to see them twice. 

World of Dance (both a dance network and touring dance competition) recently started uploading two versions of their feature performances: one with a full view of the stage, and something they call “#FRONTROW” which, as you might expect, is a super zoomed-in front row view. .

There are so many AMAZING moments in this dance that I can’t be bothered to list them all. I’d much rather you experience the awe of discovering them yourselves. This performance is so unbelievable and unreal, and it’s perfect that many of the songs and moves are inspired by magic and trickery. 

I sometimes find the front row stuff to feel too jumbled and confusing, but having seen the full-view version, I think I can appreciate the front row version a lot more. My recommendation: Watch the full-view video first, so you can see the performance as it was meant to be seen as an audience member. You’ll see the bigger trick moves and the well-synchronized choreo. 

Then, treat yourself to the front row version. See the facial expressions. Hear the dancers hitting the ground. Notice the details in the dancing that make a performance extraordinary.
