I’ve been thinking a lot lately about what it means to be both strong and a woman. Currently my takeaway is: strength is manifested in a myriad ways as is femininity, and there is no shortage of combinations of the two that are inspiring, empowering, and beautiful.

But if you happen to be looking for an example of womanly strength that is unapologetically brash and near-scarily sexy, look no further than Parris Goebel. As a woman who founded her own dance studio and fostered her own [style of dance](http://www.3news.co.nz/entertainment/polyswag-brings-hip-hop-fortune-2011081816) (I think it’s misspelled in this article; pretty sure “polyswagg” should have two g’s but whatever), Parris sets the example for badass women, and her dance style is famously intimidating and alluring.

In this video, Parris (blue track jacket) gathers BAMF ladies and throws down in the Paris metro after hours. The video has a bit of a “looks thrown together” feel but it’s communicated so well that these women just don’t care—they are strong, beautiful, and they’re here to dance so hard your face melts off. And all those abs, I mean … please.
