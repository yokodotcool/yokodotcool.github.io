Was reading a lot of books lately, so not a lot of articles. I hope to get back on that soon. 

[Don’t Be a Stranger](http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/dont-be-a-stranger/)  
*Adrian Chen, The New Inquiry*  
An article that legitimizes online friendships. Sent to me by my friend [Ken](http://siik.org), whom I first interacted with through a forum online when I was in high school. When I went to California for college I met him for the first time. We are good friends and have plenty of conventional, IRL mutual friends, even though I could count the number of times we hung out together on one hand (maybe two). 

[The Garlic Ballads](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1611457076/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1611457076&linkCode=as2&tag=yokois-20)  
*Mo Yan*  
Totally smitten with his acceptance speech, I decided to buy and read the book for which he won his Nobel Prize. Several storylines following the lives of garlic planters in a garlic-busted Chinese economy in the 1980’s. I did not really enjoy the book. It was translated poorly and seemed to lack an arc. Too bad.

[I Will Teach You to Be Rich](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0761147489/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0761147489&linkCode=as2&tag=yokois-20)  
*Ramit Sethi*  
Basically a step-by-step path of getting your personal finances in order. I ended up opening a high-yield savings account and a Roth-IRA after reading this. I feel a lot more confident about my financial options after reading this. Hat tips to [Bekka](http://bekkapalmer.com) and [Kevin](http://kiwimonk.com) for recommending this book to me.
