I actually thought about not bringing any books with me to Brooklyn. I have a Kindle and I know that books on any shelf of mine would just gather dust. But I figured my apartment could use some … nice-looking, not purely utilitarian stuff. Also I gave into the vanity of having books for show. I know. Who am I, even? 

Anyway, this is what’s packed up in the living room of my parents’ place along with 80% of my other shit:

1. [Designing Design](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/303778105X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=303778105X&linkCode=as2&tag=yokois-20) by Kenya Hara  
I remember when I first heard about this book being published. The same day, I called my mom and asked her to preorder it for my birthday. I remember savouring the whiteness of the book before I actually read it. It’s one of the few books I keep in its dust jacket because I fear marring the inner whiteness. True to Hara’s design credo, it’s simply written, so very Japanese.  
2. [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](ttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0961392142/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0961392142&linkCode=as2&tag=yokois-20) by Edward Tufte  
I’ll be honest, this is the one book in this list that I haven’t read cover to cover. I bought it around the time I started interning at the NYTimes, because I knew that a lot of the foundational principles behind the Times’ information graphics were inspired by Tufte’s work. Maybe bringing it to Brooklyn will encourage me to read it this time.
3. [The Elements of Typographic Style](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0881792063/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0881792063&linkCode=as2&tag=yokois-20) by Robert Bringhurst  
Uh, yeah. What designer doesn’t know about this book? I can’t believe I even considered giving it away. I read it through once, but I don’t really consult it while I’m working as I originally expected I would (maybe I should). But it is definitely pretty enough to stand on a shelf all by itself.
4. [Glimmer](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594202338/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1594202338&linkCode=as2&tag=yokois-20) by Warren Berger  
This book was my life-changing, “I have a purpose” book. I bought it not long after I graduated from college, still green and confused and all. Reading that the work I do, the thought processes it involves, is capable of world-changing things was nothing short of self-validating and inspiring.  
If you were to look at my copy of this book, you’ll see that unlike the other three books, which I try to keep in good condition, it has been *used*. I even passed it along to a friend, encouraging him to write in the margins like I did. It’s a shame that Amazon doesn’t have any new copies for sale.

There’s a closed-up fireplace at my new studio. I think these will look quite nice on top of it.
