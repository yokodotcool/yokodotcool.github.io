> They’re all hands that guide the stick that draws the line in the sand.

I kickstarted [Jack Cheng’s book](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jackcheng/these-days-a-novel) some time ago, and in the months since, I’ve been getting weekly updates on its progress. They are always so well-written and the fact that I love reading them makes me all the more excited to read *These Days* when it arrives (which is soon)!

Ikea furniture was delivered today; the movers and my dad’s car full of the leftovers will come tomorrow.
