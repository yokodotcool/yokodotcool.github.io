Now for something a little different. 

My first introduction to Daisuke Omiya was in Girl Walk // All Day — a feature-length dance film set to Girl Talk’s album All Day — and [he was tap dancing on top of the Charging Bull](http://girlwalkallday.com/watch-the-film/enter-the-gentleman) in Wall Street. He was easily my favorite character, so when I learned that the producers of GW // AD were creating a new music video for Pillar Point’s Dreamin’ with just Dai, of course I was interested. 

I am blown away by Dai’s range of movement. He twists and turns and the slow motion captures it exquisitely. His style is much more contemporary than my usual steez, but this video is just too beautiful not to watch. Also, great song.

[Watch video!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUgI-iy8rKY) Super props to [Bekka](https://twitter.com/bekkapalmer), who was involved in the creation of Dreamin’ and who also gave me a heads-up about its completion. Thanks B! Also props to [Jacob](http://twitter.com/jacobkrupnick) of [Wild Combination](http://wildcombination.com/), for producing such a wonderful piece.

		It is also imperative that you take the time to watch <a href="http://girlwalkallday.com/">Girl Walk // All Day</a>. You know when you hear about “dance movies” and you get really excited, but then you are disappointed to find that that 90% of the movie is not dancing but … movie stuff? Wait, is that just me? Anyway, GW // AD is not that; there is dancing throughout the film and it is extraordinary throughout. The entire film is available online, in easily digestible and incredibly addicting snippets.
