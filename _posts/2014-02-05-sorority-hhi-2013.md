Sorority is a mostly-female (seven women, one man at the time of this video) dance crew based in New Zealand. They are part of The Royal Family, a megacrew consisting of four other smaller dance crews (one is ReQuest, led by Parris Goebel [whom you may remember]({% post_url 2014-01-15-parris-goebel-get-like-me %})). Both placed top 3 in their divisions at last year’s World Hip Hop Dance Championships, and I had a really difficult time choosing between their two performances to highlight this week. 

Ultimately I ended up going with Sorority because the smaller crew size allows the camera to come in a lot closer, and you can get a better look at their terrifyingly fierce expressions. I watch this and imagine that these ladies and gentleman could eat me for breakfast. The “Twerk It” segment that starts about a minute in gives me the chills.

		Obviously, I cannot send this newsletter without including the The Royal Family megacrew’s gold-medal performance too: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO-hvL64Zbk">here it is</a> (4:26). And bonus! Here’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXwO3nQPPHA">Bubblegum</a> (1:55), The Royal Family’s all-girls crew, which placed second in the championship junior division. These girls are literally 7 to 12 years old. Crowns up!
