And nowww it’s time for Woman Crush Wednesday! Which I’m coming to terms with as a thing that really exists. Here we go!

I have a HUGE thing for Koharu Sugawara as a dancer, choreographer, attractive person, and possible (eventual) hair goal. After watching [her dance]({% post_url 2014-05-14-koharu-emotions %}) to such feel-good songs like Mariah Carey’s “Emotions” and Clean Bandits’ “Rather Be”, this video feels ... different? Like, I feel different? Inside?

The chemistry between Koharu (black and white jersey) and Yuki (watermelon tank) is just ... I’m speechless. I love how they play off each other by doing their own versions of the choreography. They’re both so good, I don’t even know which is the real version!

I’m all gooey now.

PS Oh, hi! Do you want more Koharu? Here’s [another recent video](http://youtu.be/GN6VPCftF0c?t=2m20s) (3:42), a choreo to Pharrell’s “Come Get It Bae.” Lots of great closeups. WHY AM I BLUSHING I AM NOT BLUSHING
