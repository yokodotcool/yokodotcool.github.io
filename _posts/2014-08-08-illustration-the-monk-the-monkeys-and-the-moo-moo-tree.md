![How to draw a tree? I have no idea.](/assets/2014-08-08-The-Monk,-The-Monkeys,-and-the-Moo-moo-Tree.jpg) 

[Kevin](http://kiwimonk.com) asked if I would draw an illustration to complement *The Monk, The Monkeys, and the Moo-Moo Tree*, a poem that he had written in eigth grade. In exchange, I would receive a watermelon agua fresca. I happily agreed. 

[Here](http://kiwimonk.com/the-monk-the-monkeys-and-the-moo-moo-tree) is the poem. For something that was written by a 13 year old, it’s pretty darn good.
