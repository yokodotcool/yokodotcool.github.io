Hello! This is a page I made a while back as a way for me to easily provide recommendations for folks visiting NYC. I’m biased of course, but I think NYC is one the most amazing cities in the whole wide world, a cultural capital, and an essential visit to any traveler. You’ll find plenty to do here—so much in fact, that you’ll likely have to come back another time.

## Big ol’ map

A big annotated Google Map that I update every once in a while. You can also view the map in its native goodness [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=16FX4JH13RlT1lB_o1_keDbCWHG0&usp=sharing).

## Dance studios

I’ve been taking dance classes in the NYC for over a decade(!) for fun and fitness. My usual pattern of dance class-ing involves finding an instructure who I like, and then trying to take classes wherever they teach. Some of my consistently favorite instructors have been [Eric Jenkins](https://instagram.com/ericj616), [Bo Belza](https://www.instagram.com/b0seff), and [Stacie Webster](https://www.instagram.com/websterstacie).

I'm interested in trying more studios, and also in trying some new genres like house and gaga! If you have suggestions for a class, I'd love to hear it!

### [Broadway Dance Center](https://broadwaydancecenter.com)

One of the premier locations for dance classes spanning a huge range of disciplines—ballet, street styles, contemporary, Broadway, etc. They have professional, pre-professional, and visa programs, but nearly all of their classes are walk-in. Beginner-level classes at BDC are probably a little more challenging than beginner-level classes at most other studios. The studio is strict about taking video; always ask the instructor first.

If you’re new to dance or trying a new genre, BDC also has a great [Absolute Beginner Workshop](http://broadwaydancecenter.com/workshop/absolute-beginner-workshops) program. This is how I first started taking contemporary dance classes!


### [Peridance](https://www.peridance.com)

Another great studio similar to BDC, teaching classes from a wide range of genres (maybe even wider than BDC tbh), just a little bit smaller (fewer rooms). One of the rooms has a high vaulted ceiling with windows, and it's really fun to dance in.

### [Modega](https://linktr.ee/moversbodega)

New studio opened up in #Queens! Has a bit of that indie fresh newness and they seem to be pulling in some upcoming local (NYC/NJ) talent as instructors. Mostly street-styles and choreography classes, and I think they've also had some free-form social events.

## Reliably Delicious Food Establishments with Multiple Locations

This list is more about the local-ish chains for when you're exploring the city and need to grab a quick bite without making a huge trek. For individual recos, def check out the map above. 

### Shake Shack [(Locations)](https://www.shakeshack.com/locations/)

I would take a Shake Shack burger over In-N-Out any day, and I’m not sorry. Be on the lookout for location-specific menu items (e.g., a fried chicken burger that used to be sold only in Brooklyn). If you’re on the fence about getting the crinkle cut fries, get the fries.

### The Grey Dog [(Locations)](https://thegreydog.com/locations-hours/)

Solid lunch spot with a great neighborhood vibe. Their chicken soup with meatballs is so damn good! Order and pay at the counter, and someone will bring the food to your table (during busy hours, they also will hold tables for you while you’re waiting to order).

### sweetgreen [(Locations)](http://www.sweetgreen.com/locations/)

$10 – $15 salads hearty enough to fill you up. Most of the locations I’ve been to are airy and cute—very instagrammable. If you’re in a hurry, they have an app that you can use to order ahead of time for pick-up. Unrelated, but their app UX is fantastic.

### Bareburger [(Locations)](http://bareburger.com/)

NYC (#Queens!) burger joint with a hippie, non-GMO, fair-trade twist. Expansive menu with a bunch of protein options for your burger (including veg, obvs). Huge side portions of fries and onion rings. They use phones to take your order, so it’s easy to split the check (a huge plus for me).


### The Meatball Shop [(Locations)](http://www.themeatballshop.com/locations/)

This isn’t an Italian place; it’s a shop that specializes in meatballs. Pick the ball (they have veg balls too!), the sauce, and the sides. My favorite thing to get is the Kitchen Sink (basically a medley plate) with “family jewel” (an egg).

### Xi’an Famous Foods [(Locations)](http://xianfoods.com/locations/)

Food of the Xi’an province—a combination of Sichuan and Middle Eastern flavors (cumin, chili oil, lamb). Spicy stuff, though you can adjust spiciness with your order. Good go-to’s are the B2 lamb burger and the Ns2 spicy beef hand-ripped noodles in soup.

### Bluestone Lane [(Locations)](https://www.bluestonelaneny.com/)

I’ve heard varying opinions, but I personally like this Australian-style coffee shop. All of the baristas I’ve talked to are super friendly, and their food is good, too (though pricey).
