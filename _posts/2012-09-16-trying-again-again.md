I struggle with maintaining personal web projects, and my iteration style accommodates this bad habit â€” meaning, I have trouble committing and I make things knowing that I can change them later. 

So this is an attempt to commit. I think I just need to keep it up until I reach a point where the thing I've made has grown too big for me to ever ignore or abandon again.
