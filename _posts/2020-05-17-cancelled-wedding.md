title: Stuff we made for our (cancelled) wedding
---

Not really going to dwell on the bummer-factor of us needing to cancel our wedding, but today was supposed to be the day! I wanted to memorialize this cancelled event by sharing the comms materials and whatnot I made for it, especially since some of them have yet to see the light of day.

## Save the date

The front looks like a Sharpie drawing that has been colored in: Kevin and Yoko, side-hugging, with their free arms up in the air in the corner. There’s a big blobby egg-white-shaped speech bubble that says Save the Date, Kevin and Yoko are getting married! Sunday May 17 2020 Denver Colorado. There’s also part of the postcard back: A drawing of a panda with a meatball on its head saying Formal invitation to follow; and our website." />

Our first comms! We didn’t really have an ~ aesthetic vision ~ for the wedding when we made these, but Kev and I have always been a fan of eggs (as food, as color palette inspiration, and as a basis for a [yet-to-be-realized lifestyle brand](http://overeasy.team/)), so this is where it started. This initial inspo carried through our planning—we eventually would decide to host a brunch-vibe daytime wedding that, of course, served breakfast food.

## Invitation

![Our invitation: Hand-drawn blobby white shapes, orange yolky circles on a light gray background. The invitation text, which I guess isn’t really that important, is also hand drawn in a Sharpie-like style](/assets/images/2020-05-17-wedding-materials-invitation.jpg)

I remember fretting a lot about this invitation. I originally thought that it would be scored and folded like a greeting card, but it’s surprisingly hard to find an on-demand printer who can do that easily. It also turned out that we didn’t really have much information to include—since it would be on the website. On the back, Kevin drafted a little message to our guests: Why we’re getting married, why they’re invited, and please RSVP by so-and-so date. I liked that it was a little unconventional for a wedding invitation.

There are also stickers that say “Sup!” “Nice” “わーい (yay)” “đặc biệt (special).”](/assets/images/2020-05-17-wedding-materials-invitation.jpg)

We also made sticker sheets because, why not??? We thought about using these as guest favors, but they were easy to include in our invitation, plus if someone wasn’t able to attend, they still got a feel of the vibe we wanted our wedding to be. We also ordered like, twice as many as we needed, and then the sticker company gave us extra. They came on a roll and I had to cut them all down so they fit in the envelopes 😐

## Website

A truly collaborative effort with TONS OF _*FUN CONTENT*_. It lives on, if you want to check it out: [kevinyoko.party](https://kevinyoko.party)

## Guest favors

We had two lil gifts planned for our guests: Pins of our faces, and a zine. We still think this is a brilliant idea. If we do have a wedding, those pins are definitely making it in. I don’t know if I have the energy to create more content for a zine though. We’ll see!

![Mockups of the two pins we were planning to order, sent by our printer. One each of our faces; the outline is raised metal; the backs are those claspy things.](/assets/images/2020-05-17-wedding-materials-pins.jpg)

We did order these pins, but I’d had them shipped to the Etsy office (Brooklyn apartment life, you know?). They supposedly arrived after we started working from home, so we haven’t seen them yet.

The zine was supposed to be about 16 – 20 pages long, and I’d imagined it would include some intros about us, a timeline of our relationship, a map of Sunset Park (for when folks visit), and other random things. Here are sketches of some of the “other random things” we might have included:

![It’s a sketch titled “Yoko hair evolution.” There are 10 heads with my face on it, and they’re numbered from the year 2011 when Kevin and I met, through 2020 when we were supposed to get married. The heads for 2019 and 2020 are just surrounded by question marks.](/assets/images/2020-05-17-wedding-materials-sketches-1.jpg)

This was drawn in 2018, right after we got engaged (which is why 2019 and 2020 are “unknown.” It was one of the first ideas we had to include in the zine. 

![A sketch titled “Kevin outfits.” There are four drawings of Kevin wearing various outfits and doing various activities: “Skin suit” Kevin with a kendama; “Fly boyscout” Kevin with devil sticks; “Chill fisherman” Kevin with a Rubik’s cube; and “Slimfit astronaut” Kevin with an ukulele.](/assets/images/2020-05-17-wedding-materials-sketches-2.jpg)

Also, some comics about us and our lives. One day I’m going to write a separate post and have these be bigger images so you can actually read them:

<figure>
	<img src="/assets/images/2020-05-17-wedding-materials-comics-1.jpg" alt="Two comics, squished together so they’re hard to read. The first comic is about how we like to do random things to “immortalize” a day aka make it a day we never forget. The second is about how I’m disciplined about waking up on time on weekdays, and it’s the complete opposite on the weekends." />
	<figcaption>
		I think it’s funny that I chose to reduce the fidelity of Kevin in the last panel of the second comic.

	<img src="/assets/images/2020-05-17-wedding-materials-comics-2.jpg" alt="Two more comics, still hard to read. The first comic is about a time we ate a bunch of ribs while in Austin, TX. The second is about a time I had a crappy day, and Kevin made it better by buying McDonald’s for dinner." />
	<figcaption>
		It’s kind of incredible to me that both events in these comics actually happened. Kevin is an extraordinary person 😍

## In conclusion

Our wedding would have been dope, but it did not happen. But I’m a millennial designer who has a website so I sure as heck am not going to let all the #content I created stay hidden away forever.
