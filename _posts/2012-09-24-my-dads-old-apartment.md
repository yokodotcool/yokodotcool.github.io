You'd probably never guess because his English is not so great, but my dad has lived here for quite some time. This weekend, he told me about a different apartment in the UWS that he used to live in, in the 60's. He said lived in a tiny, tiny one bedroom behind Lincoln Center for *$36.40/month*. 

And then at some point he didn't feel like living there, so he sublet it for $72/month and made some money off of his tiny 1BR. 

And then a few years later, he moved out and got his security deposit back — yup, $36.40.

The next time I go back to my parents', I'm going to try to find a photo of that apartment. Or at least, a photo of my dad in the 60's. I think he was pretty handsome!
