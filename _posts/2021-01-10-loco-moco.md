![A screenshot of a group chat with KM and KQ. I sent a photo of the loco moco that we made for dinner. They responded with some Hawaiâ€™ian slang. I said that I would Google them.](/assets/images/2021-01-10-loco-moco-chats.jpg)

(I was not successful in not opening any of the things yesterday but) Just came here to say, grateful for my friends. Not just these two, but in general.
