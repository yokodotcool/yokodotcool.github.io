I’m no expert at [locking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locking_(dance)), but I know that it’s HARD. Super hard. It’s technically and athletically challenging, and (many would argue) the moves that distinguish the dance from other funk styles are VERY specific. And it’s especially hard because, probably more than any other urban dance, locking is about making those moves look effortless.

My experience watching locking is largely in the battle context ([example](http://us3.campaign-archive1.com/?u=896d790578b2a99d6a42c4cb7&id=10d9010518)), so when I see a whole crew locking for their performance and succeeding, I’m not surprised at all that they win first place in the Hip Hop International World Competition. Lock N Lol Crew from South Korea just nails this performance. I think my favorite part is where they “give examples” of locking and related dance styles, starting at [3:04](https://youtu.be/qTX6TJGFanQ?t=3m4s). They even throw in the NaeNae at [2:02](https://youtu.be/qTX6TJGFanQ?t=2m2s).

Groove alone is difficult to achieve, but to have several dozen people grooving in sync is damn near impossible in my mind, and Lock N Lol Crew makes it look so easy! The final groove starting at 3:23 is just [insane](https://youtu.be/qTX6TJGFanQ?t=3m23s). When the audience starts to cheer in reaction, I could cry. Hats off (literally!).

Turn up that bass—you’ll be thankful for it at [1:46](https://youtu.be/qTX6TJGFanQ?t=1m46s).

<small>PS: Did you even notice that a guy trips and falls during the performance? Here’s a [wider view](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciT2JdJBAP4) of the performance where you can see it a little better (it happens around [1:27](https://youtu.be/ciT2JdJBAP4?t=1m27s)). He rolls it out and runs back in like he did it on purpose.</small>
