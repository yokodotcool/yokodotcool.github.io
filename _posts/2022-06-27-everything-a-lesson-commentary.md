I made a thing! [Here it is]({% post_url 2022-06-26-everything-a-lesson %})!

I was doodling in a notebook trying to ~ express some thoughts ~ and I started writing: <span style="font-family: cursive;">everything can be a lesson</span>

And as I was writing it, this other thought popped into my head and I wrote it down: <span style="font-family: cursive;">not everything needs to be a lesson</span>

And then I was like, These phrases share structural similarities but express very different perspectives, wouldn't it be neat if there was a way to show that? At first I imagined those [airport departure flipboards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj32w5z81Ak) or a single one of [these prism thingies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivision). And then I was like, Oh wait maybe I can try to code this lol.

I wanted to keep it lightweight and tightly scoped because I have a tendency to try all the things, get caught in rabbit holes, and give up before accomplishing anything. So I tried to keep it as straightforward as possible â€” still took me many hours, but less than a full day! Go me.

I built it in Codepen first:

<p class="codepen" data-height="480" data-default-tab="html,result" data-slug-hash="zYWOZKG" data-user="yokodotcool" style="height: 480px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">
    <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/yokodotcool/pen/zYWOZKG">Everything a lesson</a> by Yoko Sakao Ohama (<a href="https://codepen.io/yokodotcool">@yokodotcool</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>

And then!!! In another evening (right now lol) I figured out how to make a stripped-down layout template that would make it straightforward to copypaste the Codepen content into my own website, so I could (conceivably) transfer future Codepen projects into my site without a lot of effort.
