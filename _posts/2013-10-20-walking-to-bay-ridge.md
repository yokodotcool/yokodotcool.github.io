Today was such a fulfilling day despite a late start. [Sophia](http://twitter.com/SophiaRichter) came down to Sunset Park early this afternoon, and after a leisurely lunch at [Bronco](http://www.yelp.com/biz/tacos-el-bronco-brooklyn-2) and a very mediocre coffee at [Café Lore](http://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-lore-brooklyn) (I guess they’re well-rated for their Italian food, which I’ll have to verify one day) we walked from Sunset Park all the way down to Bay Ridge, the very end of the R train.

Saw some feral cats, made an unsuccessful attempt at infiltrating the Brooklyn Army Terminal, then basically walked several miles on a greenway down to the Verrazano Bridge underpass.

Sometimes, especially lately, I get really tired of the city life. I’ve been lucky enough to have to opportunities to leave NYC every couple weeks, but today made me feel like I could escape the hustle and bustle of urbania without going very far. I just love being along the water.

And now, I’m back at Sunset Park, watching football while Kev makes chili. Can’t complain, can’t complain.
