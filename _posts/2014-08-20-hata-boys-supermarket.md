Rie Hata is a Tokyo-based choreographer whose self-titled crew consists of incredibly talented dancers who are half my age.

Sigh.

This video is second of a three-part series where she showcases each of her crew’s subdivisions (here are the [other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxJfSckPsgs) [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsq8UGkrCfE); 3:59 and 3:01 respectively). I don’t have many words that do this video justice. It’s as if Rie Hata dumped a vat of swag onto all these kids and put them on a street in front of a camera. They even do the [Nae Nae](http://deadspin.com/the-nae-nae-a-necessary-explainer-1549864901)!

Make sure to watch to the end, where the boys infiltrate a grocery store. I think I’m most impressed by the fact that any Japanese establishment allowed for such shenanigans.

PS The whole crew, [Rie Hata Tokyo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPrxw0w7Pmg), placing second in the junior division at this year’s Body Rock (6:24)
