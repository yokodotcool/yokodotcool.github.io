[One of Many](http://oneofmany.co), a project by fellow [Studiomate](http://studiomates.com) [Wesley](http://wesleyverhoeve.com), is a twelve-month photo essay series featuring creative people in 12 US cities.

I was super excited and flattered when Wesley asked if I would letter the twelve cities for his project. The workflow was so elegantly straightforward and Wesley was lovely to work with. Thanks Wesley!

One of Many just went live a couple days ago, with its first photo essay on folks in [Charleston, SC](http://essays.oneofmany.co/charleston).
