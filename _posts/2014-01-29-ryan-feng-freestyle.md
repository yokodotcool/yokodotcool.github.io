I did not really watch America’s Best Dance Crew, but when I first saw season 3 champions Quest Crew perform, I was instantly hooked. This is a fairly early video that I came upon during one of my deep-dive Quest binge-watching sessions. It features only Ryan “Feng” Feng (though you can hear everyone else in the background), freestyling to the Robocop theme. 

Feng is my favorite Quest member because of his ability to (1) freestyle and (2) [pop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popping) without looking like a complete robot. The video is a bit blurry but you can still see how great he is at anticipating beats and having a move to hit them perfectly. [Starting at around 1:40](http://youtu.be/Qo0TdFlPPsQ?t=1m40s), Feng just nails a bunch of bass notes, sound effects, and claps. You can hear how impressed their crewmates are.

		It’s really worth checking out some of Quest’s unchoreographed performances. Quest was strong enough as a crew to win ABDC, but I think their biggest asset is that each member has a very distinct individual style, which they highlight when taking the stage one at a time. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvonsmV_Iyo">Here is a great freestyle set</a> (5:43) including almost all of the members (at a high school graduation party), and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dn-7h2JRMIQ">here’s a bonus video</a> (1:54) of Feng freestyle-dancing to Dominic “D-Trix” Sandoval’s freestyle-beatboxing.
