Based on this [song](https://soundcloud.com/djfreshdirect/azealia-banks-fuck-up-the-fun) by Azealia Banks and Diplo&#42;. I wanted to make a T-shirt of it, but I didn’t have the guts to purchase and wear anything with cuss words, so I made a censored version.

![Don’t — with a — when the — in her punch.](/assets/images/2013-03-01-dont_fuck_with_clean-800x1236.jpg)

Both versions are still available as prints: [Fresh](http://society6.com/psyoko/dont-fuck-with-a-bitch#1=45) and [Clean](http://society6.com/psyoko/dont--with-a--fresh_print#1=45).

&#42; I made this shirt/design way before I found out Azealia Banks had a habit of being a bigot :(
