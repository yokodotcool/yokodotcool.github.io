I love outdoor videos like this because you can see a dancer move relative to the real world. It’s especially the case with waacking (the name of this dance style—for a primer, see this [past WAWD with Princess Lockeroo]({% post_url 2014-04-02-princess-lockeroo %})), where the arms are just so dang fast.

Chrissy’s movement is so fluid, but she manages to fully extend her arms to hit the right beat. Considering how quickly she’s moving, it’s impressive that she can reach that far at exactly the right moment.

Plus, I am hypnotized by this woman’s perpetual smize and how unfazed she is by the people ogling her as she dances on this rainy Ximen street. Chrissy! You are gorgeous. Is it possible that I chose this video because I have hair-and-face-crush on this woman? We just can’t know for sure.
