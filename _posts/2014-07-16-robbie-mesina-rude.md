This sonnng though. Guysss!

Robbie Mesina is a newcomer to the dance video scene (he’s the one cheesin real hard in the red shorts), but I probably would never have guessed that unless, after falling in love with this video, I hadn't desperately scoured the internet for more. He only has two total uploads! Two! And they’re both so good!

How could you not be charmed by that smile? How could he make dancing look so easy and fun? This video is just so short and so sweet, and it makes me think, “Why am I not dancing, like right this second?”

Welcome to the internet, Robbie! You're doing great, keep it up.

*And then listen to the song on repeat forever.*

Sup! [Here’s his one other video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6li_1YrJts0) (1:27). Different feel, slightly less polished in art direction maybe? But his choreography is unmistakably stellar. So excited to see more!
