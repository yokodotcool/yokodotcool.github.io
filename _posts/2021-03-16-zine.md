I’m finally acting on making a zine! I make them to fulfill a desire to create and share on my own terms — to draw, to work with my hands, and to snail mail it to anyone who wants it. So far the zines have been about what’s going on in my life, though it’s possible that might evolve or change. As long as I continue to make them, **the latest issue will always be free**.

I try to keep a signup form open at all times, so even if you miss an issue you can always catch the following one. About a week or two before I ship the next issue, I send a “last call” email out to folks who’ve signed up to be notified.

Here’s a list of past issues: 
<ol reversed>
	<li><a href="/zine-3">Summer's ending :(</a> (Shipping September 2021)</li>
	<li><a href="/zine-2">It's another zine from meee</a> (May/June 2021)</li>
	<li><a href="/zine-1">My first zine</a> (March/April 2021)</li>
</ol>

<small>This is something that I’m doing entirely for fun, and I’m not interested in making a business out of it. However, if it brings you joy to tip folks for doing stuff like this, then I won’t say no! You can find me on Venmo, CashApp, or PayPal @yokodotcool. And though I’m not particularly interested in scaling this project, you’re welcome to share it with other people if you think they’ll enjoy it too :)</small>
