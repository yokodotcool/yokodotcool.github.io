My person-crush on Koharu Sugawara [knows no bounds]({% post_url 2014-10-15-koharu-cocaine %}). When I recently learned that she was dating Suleman Malik of [Quick Crew]({% post_url 2014-06-25-quick-crew-odd-look %}), I had a tiny, lonely freakout session in front of my computer. I’d seen Koharu and Suleman show up in [each other’s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yKv7Z2_ajA) [class videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0a_5FXX8FI) before (1:26 and 2:30, respectively), but I realize now that their dance styles are really complimentary. Doesn’t it feel great to know that two people can fit together in that way?

Sorry, so cheesy.

Anyway, this performance is definitely has a moodier, darker feel. There’s something about watching two extremely talented dancers in a performance where they’re acting emotionally at odds with each other ... it’s hypnotizing and heart-wrenching, and it really helps that it’s to The freakin Weeknd, of all musical artists. It’s also really nice to see Suleman’s individual style get augmented when he’s dancing outside of his crew. Koharu, as always, makes me feel all weird inside (in a good way).

PS [Another choreo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJ4ilOPxu0c) (5:31) that Koharu and Suleman did together. It’s to “Roll with Me” by Boyz II Men, so you know it’s real adora-sensual.
