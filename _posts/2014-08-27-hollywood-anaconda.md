I recently started following Jose “Hollywood” Ramos after tracking down all of the very fine gentlemen from [this WAWD]({% post_url 2014-01-15-parris-goebel-get-like-me %}) and after hearing that he split his teaching time between a studio in LA and Broadway Dance Center, where I take class.

I really like this particular class video because the students put in as much work (or werq) as Hollywood does and it shows. There are four different groups, each one more fierce than the one before. And Hollywood isn’t even last—his group is first! (He’s the one in the center, in all white.)

I love to watch dance students take what they’ve learned and make it their own. It shows that choreography is a living, evolving thing. Also, the center kid in group 3, the one with the perpetual stank-face, is my favorite.

It’s to that ri-donk-ulous (pun intended) Nicki Minaj song, “Anaconda.” Consider yourself warned.
