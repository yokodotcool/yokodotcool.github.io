Iâ€™ve written about [Parris Goebel]({% post_url 2014-01-15-parris-goebel-get-like-me %}) and her [New Zealand crew]({% post_url 2014-02-05-sorority-hhi-2013 %}) some time ago, and in case you were wondering, sheâ€™s still freaking killinâ€™ it. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever seen a dancer so consistently, remarkably fierce the way she is.

This class video has two parts: a select group of students performing the routine Parris taught; and Parris performing it herself. You really think, especially with the lady in the knee pads doing the drop-split at the end ([0:55](https://youtu.be/OZxRXej-guk?t=55s)), that the students have bested their teacher in learning the choreography. And then you watch Parris, and she is just so incredible.

If the chest isolations ([1:46](https://youtu.be/OZxRXej-guk?t=1m46s)) donâ€™t blow you out of the water, the character that she maintains throughout the piece will keep you enraptured. The contrast between dance-mode Parris and normal Parris (when she finishes the routine at around [2:21](https://youtu.be/OZxRXej-guk?t=2m21s)) is so stark. I feel like Iâ€™ve come out of a trance at the end.
