I'm in Japan on my sabbatical and I felt like updating the look of the site, as well as do some "cleanup" with how some of the files were organized. Of course I broke my site in the process ‚Äî it's almost like it would have been too easy if I didn't lol. Jekyll and Git continue to be a mysterious abyss and I'm only worthy of playing in their shallows. Much like the ocean üåä

Anyway some things that I tried this time:
- Went dark mode. I keep wanting to try some kind of dynamic light/dark thing but I don't know how to do it with Jekyll. So maybe next time. It took forever to decide on colors. Colors are so hard man
- Added a little bit of styling for post meta content. I used `dl`s instead of `ul`s and I think it kinda makes more sense since headers + content are kind of a key + value(s) pair!
- Got rid of Google Fonts, because I'm trying to limit external dependencies mostly out of principle. Back to my high school days of using webfont ~ *Trebuchet MS* ~. And TNR titles for the lols (but also they look kinda nice in italics? Maybe my taste is going stale). Also went huge with the fonts ‚Äî tiny fonts is one of those HS things I probably shouldn't carry over.
- I tried to get more semantic with my HTML and it also helped me get rid of the random CSS classes I made to aid with styling. Also it was kind of fun to just play with the organizational framework of the code, and I hope it's a little easier to understand for future me. It helped when I was making tweaks to the grid breakpoints, so I guess it worked!

I added a lil section on the homepage to surface some of the recent post content. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I'm also trying a [new browser](https://arc.net/) on [Robin Sloan's recommendation](https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/new-avenues/#arc). It's pretty nifty so far!
