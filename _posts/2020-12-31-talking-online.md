I recently joined two internet group chats (a Slack team with my high school friends, and a Discord server with my college friends), and Kev observed that I seemed really in my element interacting with them. I think it’s because there’s an asynchronous aspect to the communication. 

I generally don’t feel comfortable saying things unless I’ve had a few moments to think about it, and sometimes that isn’t fast enough for me to keep up with the conversation. But when it’s over chat, I can process and respond on my own time. 

As a result, I feel like I project a more representative version of myself. Now I guess I’m wondering how related this is to my self-identification as an introverted person.
