There’s something about Camillo Lauricella—every time he dances it’s like he’s putting on a full-on show (see this [last writeup]({% post_url 2014-10-29-camillo-lauricella-got-me-good %})). It’s not just that he’s great at choreography, or that he’s getting the moves right. It’s that every time he dances, he dances as if everyone is watching, and that instantly makes it into a spectacular performance.

To be fair, this time around it’s also because he’s blocked out the choreography into grouped sections ([Koharu + Yuki]({% post_url 2014-10-15-koharu-cocaine %}) cameo!) and turned the dance class studio into a multi-level stage. Oh and, of course, the fans. I swear to you, the top-button-only look is totally a thing, and I am l-o-v-i-n-g it.

When Koharu hits the drum beat at [0:47](https://youtu.be/mbH-ipfLeVc?t=47s) I die. I DIE!!! I’m dead.

PS: [Another instance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmNvinZIeeM) (2:15) of top-button-only shirts being a thing, this time by Johnathan Shay of The Company. Oh, and the choreo is pretty good too (starts at [0:44](https://youtu.be/KmNvinZIeeM?t=44s)).
