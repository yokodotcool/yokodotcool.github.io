In this issue:
- Summer’s ending, and I’m bummed about it. But there are some nice things about this time of year.
- I took time off from work, and it ended up being good for my work brain.
- I'm coming to terms with being the oldest person in the groups I’m in ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯
- Plus, a bonus chart thing I drew on the back side of the zine!
