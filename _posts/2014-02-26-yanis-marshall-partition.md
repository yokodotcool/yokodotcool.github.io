Slightly self-promotion-y preface: I’m going to be performing in the [Broadway Dance Center Student Showcase](https://www.broadwaydancecenter.com/workshops/student_performance/index.shtml) this May, and my instructor Eric informed us that the women in his dance are required to wear heels. Heels?! Like ... pumps? No, he said, not those “kitten” heels. Heels. 

So, along with practicing at work by changing from my snow boots into the highest heels I own (a respectable, but by no means impressive, 3") and reluctantly searching for heels dance classes, I’ve been watching this guy, French heels-virtuoso Yanis Marshall.

Did you notice that he’s the only person wearing heels in the entire room? This isn’t even a heels class (though he does teach a heels class) and he’s wearing heels. This video makes me fear for my ankles. Look at how pointy those things are! When he does that little [kick-turn thing at 0:47](http://youtu.be/AY7fY0OS90w?t=0m47s), my muscles seize. And then, of course, he has to [roll around and lip-sync the French part of the song](http://youtu.be/AY7fY0OS90w?t=1m6s) because he actually knows French. Ugh.
