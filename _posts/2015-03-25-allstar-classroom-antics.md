I follow a ton of dancers, but it’s still a rare occasion where I recognize every single dang person on stage. This video, while a few years old, features some of THE most talented and extraordinary performers on the urban dance internet scene, as well as (in my opinion) the chief influencers of today’s up-and-coming urban dancers.

What a treat it is to see them all together! I love that each of the dancers get to highlight some of their signature styles—[Shit Kingz]({% post_url 2014-03-26-shit-kingz-hip-drop %}) with their playful but tight coordination; [Keone and Mari]({% post_url 2014-01-08-keone-mari-madrid %}) with their couples-choreography; [Lyle Beniga]({% post_url 2014-04-30-lyle-beniga-cold %})’s hard-hitting, super-badass set; and Shaun Evaristo (makes an appearance in this [airport dance video]({% post_url 2014-02-19-justin-biebers-dancers-at-the-airport %})), who manages to stay in his “nerd” character all the way until his explosive comeback at the end. It all fits into the “classroom” storyline quite well.

Plus, at the very very end, there is a quick appearance by Lando Wilkins, whom I haven’t written about yet but one day hope to, because he is also incredible. He’s the “teacher,” which I think is pretty funny because (I think?) they’re all more or less the same age.

If I were at this show in person, I would likely not have been alive today to tell you about it, because I would have died right on the spot. Enjoy!
