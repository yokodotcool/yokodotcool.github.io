Solid Saturday morning. 

Stocked up at the farmer’s market.

Jumped rope at Cat Park (saw Darth Nose, Sergeant Splotch, General Splotch, Zorro; also saw some goose parents with baby geese).

In the foreground you can see the orange blossom lemonade he ordered, as well as a bag of 45th Street blend coffee](/assets/images/2021-05-15-outdoor-coffee-yafa.jpg)

Stopped by Yafa on our way back. We bought our first “we’re just gonna eat this now, outside” food (cold brew, lemonade), and we sat at their outdoor dining space. We took our masks off and sipped our drinks. Huge!

Took a wall photo. Also a first since pandemic, I think.

He’s wearing a baseball cap, a facemask, a “Anti Running Running Club” long sleeve, some black shorts, and a pair of red and blue trailrunning shoes. A collection of community artwork is wheatpasted on the wall behind him.](/assets/images/2021-05-15-atwikd.jpg)

Kevin got a free plant and we don’t know what it is. lol

Eggs and salad from the farmer’s market, plus leftover chiles relleno and rice and beans from Isabela’s.
