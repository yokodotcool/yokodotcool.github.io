> Anything is grand if it’s done on a large enough scale.

Quoted out of context, but still. From [The Secret History](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400031702?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393185&creativeASIN=1400031702&linkCode=shr&tag=yokois-20&qid=1354503854&sr=8-1&keywords=the+secret+history) by Donna Tartt.
