Lyle is master of speed control, [we know this]({% post_url 2014-04-30-lyle-beniga-cold %}). But that still doesn’t stop me from being completely floored when he (left) and his buddy Devin (right) choreograph a routine for a song played at twice the speed. What you see here is that dance slowed to half-speed. Lyle still hits every damn beat, all the way down to the finger-wagging and jump-landing.

It’s like that part of Mariah Carey’s [music video for Heartbreaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aY_cRy_astw) ([here](http://youtu.be/aY_cRy_astw?t=1m54s)—notice how slow here hair moves and how the sound appears a bit off), except better executed (I love you Mariah).

*You should definitely watch it once, and then watch it again at twice the speed to see the pace at which they had to plan and perform this short routine. (which you can do! Along with half speed! Zerlina, are you reading this?)*
