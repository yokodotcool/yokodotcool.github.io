I haven’t quite put my finger on what exactly it is about Chris Martin’s dancing that I find so compelling. I think it has something to do with how easy he makes it look—he could be walking down the street doing this and it wouldn’t look out of place, you know? And that’s doubly impressive considering how deliberate his moves are. When you watch Chris Martin do the same choreography over and over again in different videos (here are [three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtK6xgi4Tjw) [class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51LqURxBHSg) [videos](http://youtu.be/kBC3gQ5-9Yw?t=1m46s) of the same choreo), you’ll see that even his most nuanced moves are entirely not by accident.

He also is really great at catching every single kick and bass beat. Like what is [this](http://youtu.be/KASqAyy0-5k?t=1m59s), even.

Plus it sure helps that he has a whole bunch of very talented dancers joining him in this video (you might recognize [Kevin Nguyen]({% post_url 2014-06-18-chris-dea-kevin-treasure %}) in the black sweatshirt and [Robbie Mesina]({% post_url 2014-07-16-robbie-mesina-rude %}) in the black henley). Fellaaas!

Also embarrassingly, I only recently realized that [he and Mariel Madrid]({% post_url 2014-07-09-chris-mari-virtual-insanity %}) (née Martin) are siblings. Talk about a power family!

[Watch video!](http://youtu.be/KASqAyy0-5k?t=1m14s)
*There’s a long, nonsensical intro that I’ve skipped over (that I watched in spite of not liking long intros, because I totally have a dancer crush on this guy). If you want to see it from the very very beginning, [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KASqAyy0-5k).*

PS [Here’s the other Chris Martin video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wynSGj89P1Y) that I considered posting this week—an earlier piece before (I think) he joined Cookies. His style is already established and so clean! Plus it looks like he and his buddies are having a great time.
