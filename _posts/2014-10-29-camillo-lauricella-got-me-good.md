Yeahhh buddy it’s Wednesday and I’m hittin you up early ’cause I feel like it!

One of the many things that I love about the class environment, and something that I didn’t necessarily expect when I first started taking classes, is the sheer amount of support that dancers can have for each other when the spotlight is on. People will cheer, clap, and be so forthcoming in vocalizing it when they are impressed.

Combine that with a man who puts in so much werk, and you get a rain of hats and shoes (which is a good thing). This video of Camillo Lauricella dancing to Ciara is so uplifting and energizing that you’ll be hard-pressed not to jump to your feet and shake down so hard. If I were in this room, I would be a quivering mess of a puddle.

Also the [kah-kakakah](http://youtu.be/11ys53EUF3o?t=27s) part (0:27). Is. Crazy.

PS—The choreography is a collaboration between Camillo and another person named Mecnun Giasar. [Here’s a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-Y5gsfiCYQ) of both of them dancing it together, plus with a bit more art direction ... which I guess isn’t always a great thing, but there is a ton more choreography in this one and is definitely worth a watch!
