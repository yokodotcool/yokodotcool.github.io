    Why Aren't We Dancing? (WAWD) was an email newsletter about Youtube dance videos that I wrote in 2014‚Äì2015. If you'd like to read a little bit more about this project, <a href="#wawd-commentary">jump down to the commentary</a>. Otherwise, onward to ...

<h3>What was it and why'd I start it?</h3>
<p>
    WAWD was an email newsletter about Youtube dance videos. I started it after I came to a realization that I was spending a LOT of time watching videos by dancers and choreographers, and I began to feel guilty because I had "nothing to show for it." (2022 me is like üôÑ lol). 
</p>
<p>
    So WAWD was a way to me to justify that time spent by articulating and sharing what I found so compelling about the videos I was watching. You know, to help someone understand why I would stay up until 3am, watching the same dance competition piece over and over, from multiple angles.
</p>
<p>
    Also around that time, my coworking mate Chesley had been writing Bey Cheatsheet, which was a similar newsletter but for videos of Beyonc√©'s live performances. As of 2022 it's not online anymore, but it was amazing. And it deepened my appreciation for Beyonc√© beyond even my level of fandom then. And it inspired me to make a newsletter of my own.
</p>
<h3>How'd it work? How'd it go?</h3>
<p>
    The publishing schedule started at once a week, then later slowed down to every other week. I had a private list of saved videos on Youtube that I would continuously add to and pull from for each edition. I used Mailchimp for distribution ‚Äî I liked that I could tweak the email design and easily keep track of engagement ‚Äî but I also had a Squarespace website to hold the archives because I thought that Mailchimp's archive views were limiting (no thumbnails, no way to see more than ~20 "campaigns"). 
</p>
<p>
    Because the content seemed so niche at the time, I treated each edition as a foundational layer of dance knowledge/nerdery. I remember doing quite a bit of independent research and fact-checking to make sure I wasn't misrepresenting a genre of dance or its origins. I didn't want to repeat definitions or contextualize from scratch every time, but I also wanted readers to feel like they could read a current edition without having read any of the past ones. So I also remember taking a lot of care in linking back to old editions if I was revisiting a person, a genre, or something else.
</p>
<p>
    I started the newsletter at the beginning of 2014, and I sent my "last" edition, the 63rd, in late 2015. By then I had about 650+ subscribers, which is not a viral amount but also nothing to sniff at, I think! Looking at the data now, the average open rate was ~50% and an average click rate was ~25%! Also for some reason I currently have 800+ subscribers now, which means a bunch of people signed up after I sent my last edition üòÖ
</p>

<h3>Reflections in 2022</h3>
<p>
    So yeah, I think a lot has changed since 2015! In terms of ~ the world of platforms ~ now with Tiktok dance challenges and Youtube reaction videos being a thing, I wonder how novel (or necessary) a newsletter like this would be today. 
</p>
<p>
    My circumstances have also changed ‚Äî I've since met some of the people I'd written about, which is so cool! And I also was able to find a dance community locally. Before, I felt that the dance community vibe in NYC was really different from what I was seeing in these videos, which were centered around the west coast. But I eventually found a NYC/NJ based community that had similar styles and goals. It turns out that actually meeting these people, and actually finding and joining a likeminded dance community, ended up scratching the same itch that I was scratching with this newsletter.
