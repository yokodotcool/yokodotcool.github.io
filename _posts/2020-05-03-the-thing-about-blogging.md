I just read that line from [Robin Sloan’s blog archive](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/) (I didn’t even read the actual blog post) and it just reminded me why I have this website at all. And it helped me get unstuck in writing about a project I had worked on sooo long ago that, like, who even cares? I do!!! And I had a good time working on it so I should write about it!

So I thought it was important to recognize that.
