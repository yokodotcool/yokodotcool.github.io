It's black and white. In the foreground, Parris' flat-brimmed profile is visible. She's just walked into a room of men (they are dancers lol), and it's the moment where Parris realizes it's just her. Don't worry, it ends well."></a>

This video was originally scheduled to go out in two weeks, but I could not wait to show it to y’all. It pained me even to wait until this Wednesday!

I’m only just learning about Parris Goebel, but I love her already. She started, and owns, two dance studios in New Zealand. She is the lead choreographer of ReQuest, an all-ladies dance crew that has won multiple dance competitions. She was selected to choreograph Jennifer Lopez’s world tour in 2012 … when she was 20. What???!

The amount of swagger in this video is actually insane. I love that she choreographed this routine for men, and that amid all the crotch-grabbing and chin-nodding, she sprinkles in a ton of bad-girl booty work. I find it very sexy when men can pull off more “feminine” dance moves — I think it shows comfort, tolerance, and confidence in a more gender-equalized dance community. Oh, and it looks SUPER HOT.

Also, I want all of their hats and clothes.

Also, when Parris Goebel smirks at around [2:46](http://youtu.be/B9TMzQjHK9U?t=2m46s), I just die.
