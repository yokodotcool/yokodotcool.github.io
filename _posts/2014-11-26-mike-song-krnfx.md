Is it early to be reflecting on 2014? I would say that it’s been about a year since I decided that I would turn my dance video obsession into something productive. So let’s do it! Cheers! Thanks for reading!

I wrote about Mike Song in my [very first newsletter]({% post_url 2013-12-30-wawd-000 %}), a test which was sent to just [one person](http://twitter.com/kevinhuynh), so I figure it appropriate to feature him again for this WAWD eleven-month-iversary. This time around, he’s on stage in a massive Korean arena joined by Canadian beatboxer Terry Im (aka KRNFX).

This performance is an extended version of an [older Song + Im collaboration](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPcHZE-ZDYQ) (3:29), in which Song dances to Im’s beatboxing. It is planned carefully, with the score and the choreography created precisely to match.

I have to say—and maybe this is because I have more experience watching dancers than listening to beatboxers—some of the sounds that come out of KRNFX are beyond my level of understanding. I almost didn’t share this video because I felt that the beatboxing was so good that it practically overshadowed the dancing, but who am I to deny you a show? You definitely won’t be sorry.

*A fun challenge: how many different ways can Mike Song and KRNFX open a door?*
