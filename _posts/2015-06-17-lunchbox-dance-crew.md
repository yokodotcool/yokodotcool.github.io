Ah yes, another group of very talented young dancers who will force me reflect on my relatively modest accomplishments in life. 

My favorite parts of this dance are less about the group (as it tends to be with me and crew performances), but rather parts when a few key dancers really bring the attitude up to 11, like this one young lady totally owning the point position in “[Chicken Noodle Soup](https://youtu.be/33LduBJz4xI?t=1m18s)” (!) and “[Lipgloss](https://youtu.be/33LduBJz4xI?t=2m16s)” (!!) and this [cross-stage march](https://youtu.be/33LduBJz4xI?t=4m8s) culminating in a death drop (!!!).

It’s also hard not to get hyped when the soundtrack is full of classics, and it bring me great joy to know that these dancers are using songs that were hot before they were born (cry). I have to say though, “Peaches and Cream” and “Milkshake” are definitely not literal definitions … but anyway.

PS: I tend to write more about California-based dancers, so I want to give a shoutout to the fact that these kids are from Houston TX, another dance hub that is churning out some serious talent. The WOD Dallas adult division winner, [So Real](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iktsLV_lyU) (6:59), is also based out of Houston. Like Lunch Box Crew, these guys have a distinct flavor that is decidedly Houstonian to me. Enjoy!

PPS: For further self-questioning of your life achievements, here’s the music video for [Hot Cheetos & Takis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iktsLV_lyU) (5:02). Seriously unbelievable. KIDS THESE DAYS ugh
