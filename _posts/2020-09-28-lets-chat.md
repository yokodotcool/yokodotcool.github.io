I'm available for 1:1 video calls through [Merit](https://www.get-merit.com/p/yoko-sakao-ohama)! Merit is a free mentorship platform for people who work on product teams, focused on those who are under-networked. 

## What I hope to gain

Chatting about the work helps me deepen my understanding of UX designâ€”as a discipline, an industry, and a community of pracitioners. Over the years doing these 1:1s, I've found that sharing and processing our experiences together is valuable for both parties involved. When I come away from a good chat, I often feel energized!

I'm especially interested in connecting with folks of under-represented or marginalized backgrounds, because the narrative of the design and technology field often excludes them/us. I hope to provide insight and support along the way, so that this industry can be more accessible ðŸ§¡

## What we can talk about

- Entering the field for the first time
- Collaborating across disciplines
- Navigating recruitment and promotion processes
- Pairing on a problem to solve
- Other things! You'll get more out of our chat if you come prepared with a few questions on a topic that's top of mind for you.

## Some expectation-setting

- I have a finite number of slots available each month on Merit. If I'm booked, you can [email me](mailto:ysohama+site@gmail.com) and we can try to work something out. But I'm also a human with limitations! Plus there are a lot of other qualified folks on the platform who are eager to chat :)
- I'm happy to share my experiences working at Etsy, but I can't guarantee that you'll get recruited, interviewed, or hired. 
- And of course, I can't speak to work that is confidential or material and non-public.
