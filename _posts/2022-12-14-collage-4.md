It's a collage made from some stuff that I gathered during my trip to Japan:
- Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo
	- Floormap and scenes from Wendelien Van Oldenborgh's exhibition, unset on-set.
	- Cut-out collections (and other) from the MoT archives
	- Guide to the larger/environmental works at the museum
- Cutouts from a pamphlet for a noren dyeing company
- A flyer for my cousins' theater production
- A flyer for an upcoming exhibition at the Tokyo Photographic Art Museum
