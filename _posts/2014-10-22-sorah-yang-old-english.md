I’m realizing now that I don’t see a whole lot of women who choreograph to harder hip-hop/rap. Sorah Yang says of herself: “While I absolutely love dancing to all different kinds of music, there's something about the hip hop/rap genre that lights a huge fire inside of me.” I gotta say, it’s incredibly refreshing to watch.

Not much else to say here—just a whole lot of badass choreography and some really [adorable bloopers](http://youtu.be/xHUIbWhG2LI?t=1m59s) at the end. Enjoy!
