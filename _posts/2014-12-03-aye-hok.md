Ahhh, I’ve been obsessed with Aye Hasegawa since I first saw this blurry [Bite My Swag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RwdpuOST4E) choreo (1:08) and subsequently fell into a Youtube hole of her class videos. I don’t know why I was waiting for “the right one” to write about, but I’m happy to say that I’ve found it! And bonus: it features Hok Konishi, of Quest Crew.

[Popping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popping) is one of those original funk styles that have been around for decades, and it’s so awesome to see it being constantly refreshed. (PSA: aside from [that dope Huey song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEYMaSoXQUM), “pop locking” is not really a thing. Popping is a thing; locking is a thing. Pop-locking is not. PSA over.)

Impressive skill aside, this is just the cutest dang video. I love the contrast between the rigid, isolated “mannequin” scene and the expressive, extensive-lines (I just made that up) “human” scene. Both Aye and Hok are SO GOOD AT BOTH!

PS If you can’t get enough, Aye and Hok have TWO MORE high-production videos together! Here they are, a philanderous supper with [will.i.am’s Bang Bang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BZFYNZg95k) (2:49), and a laundromat daydream sequence to [A-HA’S TAKE ON MEEE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IruTfpU_k5A) (3:28; caps and emphasis mine).
