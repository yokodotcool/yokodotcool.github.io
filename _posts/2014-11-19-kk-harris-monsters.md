You may have seen Kaelynn “KK” Goebert-Harris a few years ago as one of the standout performers of the runner-up crew 8 Flavahz on America’s Best Dance Crew. She also made a badass appearance in this [3-23 Area Kidz performance]({% post_url 2014-05-07-323-area-kidz %}) earlier this year (her part starts at [2:58](http://youtu.be/OK0kdsCjgoY?t=2m58s)).

I’m intrigued by her quote in the beginning of this video. She says that you need to stand in the front of a class or audition to be noticed, but also that the biggest (and successful, I assume) monsters are in the back. I think she’s trying to say that if you’re good enough, someone can pick you out of the crowd no matter where you’re standing, and that being in the front is a lot more about ego than it is about skill.

There’s a quiet ferocity about the way KK performs. To see her expression while she’s dancing combined with her very intricate hits, she’s like a cold, calculated evil genius. I mean, the way KK dances, I can definitely see her in the back of the room, silently planning world domination.

*I recommend watching the first two groups, who bring a different but equally fun energy to the performance. And then you watch KK, and she just **slays**.*
