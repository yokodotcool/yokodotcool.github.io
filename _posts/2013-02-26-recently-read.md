[The Pac-Man Dossier](http://home.comcast.net/~jpittman2/pacman/pacmandossier.html)  
*Jamey Pittman*  
Comprehensive coverage of the history and mechanics of the arcade game Pac-Man. I don’t even play arcade games and I found this fascinating.

[Obama’s 2013 State of the Union Address](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/13/us/politics/obamas-2013-state-of-the-union-address.html)  
*Transcript, The New York Times*  
Always good to keep up to date. I am a fan of the president so I might be biased, but even in transcript form, the address got me a bit misty-eyed toward the end. America!

[Do We Really Want to Live without the Post Office?](http://www.esquire.com/print-this/post-office-business-trouble-0213?page=all)  
*Jesse Lichtenstein, Esquire*  
> They say that you never really understand appreciate how things work until you try to change them. I think this is true. Change is not easy.  

Quote by former Postmaster Patrick Donahoe, who was subsequently ousted from his seat through a unanimous vote of no confidence by the House of Delegates.

> “Fuck you! This is a great institution and we can grow it!” That’s what you say to the Congress, “Fuck you! Let me win. I will win if you just get out of my goddamn way.” 

Quote by current Postmaster Ron Bloom.

A sort of love letter / ballot of confidence in the US Postal Service. Having worked at a startup heavily reliant on the USPS, this was much food for thought.
