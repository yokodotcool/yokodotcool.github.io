Have you heard of the phrase “in the pocket?” In jazz, blues, or funk music, it refers to multiple musicians, without the aid of some kind of leading sound or beat, being perfectly in sync and in a groove with one another. In dance (according to my instructor Eric), it’s when a dancer falls into a groove so deep with the music that they effectively become one.

Now … I feel like at this point we can just dive right into the video, because Chris Martin, with his infinite skill and charisma, needs no further explanation when it comes to being in the pocket. But here we are, so. Next paragraph!

Chris Martin’s got the footwork ([0:57](http://youtu.be/q772cjVen8U?t=57s)), the groove ([1:02](http://youtu.be/q772cjVen8U?t=1m2s)), and such an impressive grasp of the instrumentals (the hand wave at [1:29](http://youtu.be/q772cjVen8U?t=1m29s); just listen to the audience!). There’s a part in the song where Bruno Mars says “If you sexy, then flaunt it” ([0:51](http://youtu.be/q772cjVen8U?t=51s)) and all he does is SIT, and that seemingly little move adds so much meaning to the lyrical content. When the dancer can jive with the music as well as Chris Martin does, the result is a [constructive interference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_%28wave_propagation%29) that enhances the entire performance.

*There may be parts where you find yourself wrinkling your nose like you smell something funky. Spoiler alert: that is kind of the whole point of funk music and dance.*

PS: [A different class video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-frQ0Hw5iic) of the same piece, with slightly different choreographic flourishes (the magic fingers at [1:01](http://youtu.be/-frQ0Hw5iic?t=1m1s)!!!), a lot more stomping, and a greener wall.
