![A four-panel comic (“yonkoma”) where Kevin and I “immortalize” the day by doing fun and outrageous food-related experiments: eating Lil Caesars pizza and Cheetos, immersion-blending an entire watermelon into juice, and putting peanut butter on various foods (including raw onion, which is gross). In the last panel, we reminisce “to that one time” and laugh because the day has been IMMORTALIZED!]({{ "/assets/images/2018-06-29-yonkoma-immortalize.jpg"}})
