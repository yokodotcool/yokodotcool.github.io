Lots of firsts today:

- Successfully pushed a thing to address one of the [issues](https://github.com/yokodotcool/yokodotcool.github.io/issues/6) I’d made a while back.
- Pushed the thing without previewing locally (bc I can’t get Jekyll to work locally with my new laptop ☹️); [prototyped in Codepen](https://codepen.io/yokodotcool/pen/ExVmLrv) instead
- Made a CSS animation! And a CSS shape!

Also attempted a rudimentary [dark mode toggle](https://codepen.io/yokodotcool/pen/oNjWEyO) in Codepen bc it seemed like a cool idea.
