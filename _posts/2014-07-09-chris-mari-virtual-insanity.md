Is it too soon to talk about people in [Cookies]({% post_url 2014-05-21-cookies-wodla-2014 %}) dance crew? Again? Never!

I just love watching people like Chris Martin and Mari Madrid ascend the mountain of dance perfection. Already renown for their dancing and choreography, they can focus on more abstract concepts in their performances. This video succeeds not only at showing us some really great dancing, but also at teaching us a lesson about getting out of the house—Michelle Obama would be proud, no?

There are so many little lovely things about this video that I can’t wait for you to discover (okay, I gave away the dogs, but there’s more, I swear!). Also, considering Mari is often [seen]({% post_url 2014-01-08-keone-mari-madrid %}) [paired]({% post_url 2014-06-11-keone-mari-latch %}) with her husband Keone, it’s really awesome to see her doing her own thing every once in a while. You go Mari!

*Watch until the very end for the bonus Office Space homage!  
(And then go play outside.)*

Oh hey! Here are two more fantastic examples of “conceptual” Cookies performances: the [“Old Folks” routine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSoel2xP7ec) (7:09) and the [“Silent” routine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJMY44T42qE) (6:27). Both took first place two years in a row at the Body Rock competition, obviously.
