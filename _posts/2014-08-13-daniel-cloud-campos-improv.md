That’s a quote I pulled from Daniel “Cloud” Campos’ [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Cloud_Campos).

Neither physics nor physiology seem to apply to this guy. He floats and shape-shifts across the stage, defying gravity with every tumble. I was planning to share this video just to talk about how fluid Daniel Cloud Campos is, but then I found out that this performance was not choreographed, but entirely improvised on the spot.

His unreal moves are a little easier to believe when you learn that he started out as a b-boy, where quick thinking is advantageous in a battle (here’s a pretty amazing [10-minute compilation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0E4YtGkKOU0) of battles).

He also has a ton of experience just making goofy, [weird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLab3ns-xtQ) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwGvR39pzDo) of his pranky physical hijinks. Moves like [this one](http://youtu.be/hzu-DXpO7Z8?t=1m19s) (1:19) make sense when you comb the internet and unearth this video of him [pretending to fall and hit is head](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAHdcDb5XN4) (0:46).

I swear I’m not a crazy internet stalker. Hey look, [watch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzu-DXpO7Z8)!
This video is actually the second of two performances Daniel Cloud Campos did that night. Here is the first: another freestyle done to the same music (3:45).

PS If you think this guy looks REALLY familiar, it’s probably because you’ve seen him in [Step Up 3D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orkqtp9aTII), [those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr3dFSzh1yU) [promos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iB5txqIl8jQ) for the Microsoft Surface, or [that music video with Shakira](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igcsNG4aruA) (yowza!).
