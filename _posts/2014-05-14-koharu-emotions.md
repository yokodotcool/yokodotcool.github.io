A mark of a great choreographer is the ability to make someone see the music through dance. Koharu Sugawara is that sort of person. I have not seen another woman who moves in a way that makes you discover parts of a song that you’ve never heard before. 

Do you remember the first time you heard “Emotions” by Mariah Carey? Now you can relive it by watching this short but amazing choreo. A great choreographer may make you see the music, but a great dancer will make you feel it. With her extraordinary performance, Koharu does both. 

[Watch video!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CXKClVW7lo) Maybe your chest will tighten with the euphoric swelling of your heart about to explode.

Bonus! Koharu recently revamped her Youtube channel with this [irresistibly charming video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwV1l_3sM6w) (2:31), shot outside on a sunny day in (I think) Shinjuku, Tokyo. She’s gathered a cast of dancers dressed as varying flavors of the “quintissential Japanese citizen,” and I think it’s a picturesque view on how Japanese folks view their daily life. I just love the suited businessman and the bandana’d blue-collar worker alongside the aproned “mother” figure and the uniformed school kids. So dang cute!
