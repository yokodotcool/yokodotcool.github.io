Hey, have you ever seen Justin Bieber’s [“Beauty and the Beat” music video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ys7-6_t7OEQ)? The one at the pool, that kind of looks like it’s all shot in one take except Justin jumps into the water and comes out with his hair perfectly styled? 

This video is like that music video, except there’s no Justin but only his dancers. They are stuck at Hartsfield-Jackson after their flight gets cancelled, and decide to pass the time by living my ultimate fantasy of breaking out into coordinated dance in public. Impressively, all of the dancing is shot in one single, glorious, hot mess of a take. 

There is a difference between dancing and performing. I could be super critical about the mechanics of this video, but when I see how much fun it looks like they’re having, do I really care about the synchronicity, the blocking, or the steadiness of the camera? Nope. I challenge you to watch this without smiling. Good luck!
