Not long after my departure from Tattly, I did a quick, fun lettering project for [CreativeMornings](http://creativemornings.com)! Their [Summit](http://ink361.com/app/tag/cmsummit14), which gathered nearly 200 CM organizers from around the world under one roof, required nametags for each of the attendees, and I was more than happy to do a few of them.

Basically, I left Tattly one day and walked back into the Studiomates the next day, is how it happened. Really though, I shouldn’t be surprised!

Super bonus: I got comfortable with drawing script uppercase J’s.
