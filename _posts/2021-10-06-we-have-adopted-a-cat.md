![A gif of Soleil, our cat, in our bathroom. He has white fur with caramel patterning; of note is the caramel mustache just under his nose. He is hiding between the toilet seat and the washer-dryer so that you can only see his head sticking out from behind the toilet. In the gif, the view zooms on his face as he slowly blinks.](/assets/images/2021-10-06-soleil-toilet.gif)

His name is Soleil and he is a \~13lb boy cat of about 6 years. He has white fur with caramel patterning along his head and back. Of visual note is his lopsided mustache and a light-dark brown striped tail, which leads Kevin to believe that Soleil is a mystical creature.

We are still getting used to cat-cohabitation! Exciting times for us. Much appreciation to rescuer G at [Brooklyn Animal Action](https://brooklynanimalaction.org/), and foster S, who first introduced us to this special boy.
